    <!-- it's wise to give each of your forms a 'name' attribute, like below: -->

    <form name="user-info">

        <!-- There are many different kinds of input fields, and most of them still use 
        the <input/> tag, but can be used by giving <input/> different attributes. The big 
        one is 'type'. type defaults to text. So our "First Name" input box is already 
        <input type="text"/> -->

        <div id="first-name">Morgan</div>

        <input type="text">

        <!-- Number restricts the inputs to numbers, and give you up and down arrows to 
            increment or decrement it. Number also has more attributes to help you control 
            how the input box behaves. For type="number" the common ones are: min, max, step
            Min and max are exactly what the sound like. They restrict the minimum and the 
            maximum value of the input box. Step controls how much the up and down arrow 
            move our number. Play around with this input box 
            Number: <input step="10" type="number"/>: -->

        <input step="10" type="number" />

        <!-- Your step can also be decimals. Here is a list of just some of the other 
            attributes you can give your input box:
            * name - Important for naming and using your input boxes. Similar to id
            * value - Value gives your input and initial value
            * placeholder - Placeholder gives your user an example or hint of what belongs 
            in an input box
            required - From will not submit if you have this attribute in an empty input box
            Many of these attributes are using by your browser to help with autofill. 
            Especially the name attribute. If you say name="firstname", Chrome can autofill 
            that for your user. -->
